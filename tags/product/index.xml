      <description>After three years and five months of being a software engineer at Wikimedia, I decided to step into the role of a product manager at Wikimedia in April 2018. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an abrupt change. I&amp;rsquo;d been toying with managing products since early 2017 and I was lucky to have a manager who was willing to give me a chance. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of good advice out there about how to transition into product manager which you will undoubtedly find helpful if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to make the switch.</description>
