      <description>One of the perks of working at an open source organization like mine is that I get to talk about my work projects with the world. Everything I do as part of my work is public and accessible to anyone who wishes to see it.
TemplateWizard is one of the first projects I undertook as a Product Manager that has major user-facing functionality. The project was requested during the 2017 Community Wishlist Survey and made it to #5 in the results.</description>

      <description>After three years and five months of being a software engineer at Wikimedia, I decided to step into the role of a product manager at Wikimedia in April 2018. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an abrupt change. I&amp;rsquo;d been toying with managing products since early 2017 and I was lucky to have a manager who was willing to give me a chance. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of good advice out there about how to transition into product manager which you will undoubtedly find helpful if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to make the switch.</description>
