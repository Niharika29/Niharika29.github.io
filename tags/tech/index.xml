      <description>After three years and five months of being a software engineer at Wikimedia, I decided to step into the role of a product manager at Wikimedia in April 2018. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an abrupt change. I&amp;rsquo;d been toying with managing products since early 2017 and I was lucky to have a manager who was willing to give me a chance. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of good advice out there about how to transition into product manager which you will undoubtedly find helpful if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to make the switch.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting a MediaWiki instance</title>

      <description>This was my first time backing up and setting up a new MediaWiki (-vagrant) instance from scratch so I decided to document it in the hope that future me might find it useful.
We (teams at Wikimedia) often use MediaWiki-Vagrant instances on Labs, err, Cloud VPS to test and demonstrate our projects. It&amp;rsquo;s also pretty handy to be able to use it when one&amp;rsquo;s local dev environment is out of order (way more common than you&amp;rsquo;d think).</description>

      <title>Who&#39;s a senior developer?</title>

      <description>Something at work today prompted me to get thinking about what people generally mean when they say they are/someone is a senior developer.
There are some things which are a given - long-term technical experience, fairly good knowledge of complex languages and codebases, past experience working on products and so on.
But in my opinion, there are a fair number of things which we don&amp;rsquo;t really talk about but are important skills a &amp;ldquo;senior&amp;rdquo; developer must possess to actually deserve that title.</description>

      <title>An Eventlogging adventure</title>

      <description>What the heck is eventlogging? Eventlogging is a MediaWiki extension which lets us log events such as how users interact with a certain feature (client-side logging) or capturing the state of a system (user, permissions etc.) when a certain event happens (server-side logging). There are 3 different parts to eventlogging an event. The schema, the code and the log data. I won&amp;rsquo;t be going into the details of that because there&amp;rsquo;s a detailed guide for it.</description>
