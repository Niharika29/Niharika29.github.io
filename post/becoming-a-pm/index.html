            <p>After three years and five months of being a software engineer at Wikimedia, I decided to step into the role of a product manager at <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org">Wikimedia</a> in April 2018. It wasn&rsquo;t an abrupt change. I&rsquo;d been toying with managing products since early 2017 and I was lucky to have a manager who was willing to give me a chance. There&rsquo;s a lot of good advice out there about how to transition into product manager which you will undoubtedly find helpful if you&rsquo;re looking to make the switch. In this blog post however I want to highlight one critical piece of information I was missing and how that affected me.</p>

<p>I was a regular attendee in product meetings and speaking up a lot. Coming up with good product ideas and questions. The team product manager gave me lots of good feedback and even at one point said to me <em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make a great product manager!&rdquo;</em>. Great, I thought! I was sending out all the right signals. Of course I&rsquo;ll be considered for the PM role, wouldn&rsquo;t I? <em>Wrong.</em></p>

<p><strong>I was making the classic rookie mistake. I wasn&rsquo;t outright asking for what I wanted.</strong> I was relying on the manager to somehow interpret my enthusiasm as an obvious ask that I wanted that role. I couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong.</p>

<p>A month later, my manager announced in a team setting that the project I&rsquo;d been working on with him was being handed off to someone outside the team who was looking to get into product management and had asked for this project. I was devastated. <em>How could they do this to me? Didn&rsquo;t I prove myself capable of doing this project already?</em> I thought about it over and over and finally mustered the courage to go confront my manager about it. His reaction was utter surprise. He had no idea I wanted the role! Once he realized that, my gem of a product manager went back to the other guy and explained the situation. Thankfully he understood and <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Tech/Grant_metrics_tool">the project</a> was mine.</p>

<p>My takeaways from this episode was: <strong>Be bold and ask for what you want</strong>. Even if you think it&rsquo;s too late to ask for it, just do it. My life today could have been very different if I hadn&rsquo;t had the courage to go up to my manager and ask for that project. The downsides to being refused are few but the downsides to <em>not asking</em> are tremendous.</p>
