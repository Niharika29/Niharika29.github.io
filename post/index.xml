      <description>Something at work today prompted me to get thinking about what people generally mean when they say they are/someone is a senior developer.
There are some things which are a given - long-term technical experience, fairly good knowledge of complex languages and codebases, past experience working on products and so on.
But in my opinion, there are a fair number of things which we don&amp;rsquo;t really talk about but are important skills a &amp;ldquo;senior&amp;rdquo; developer must possess to actually deserve that title.</description>

      <description>What the heck is eventlogging? Eventlogging is a MediaWiki extension which lets us log events such as how users interact with a certain feature (client-side logging) or capturing the state of a system (user, permissions etc.) when a certain event happens (server-side logging). There are 3 different parts to eventlogging an event. The schema, the code and the log data. I won&amp;rsquo;t be going into the details of that because there&amp;rsquo;s a detailed guide for it.</description>

      <description>The what, the why, the when, the who, the how: I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding for a while now, mostly on Wikimedia projects. Every time I get stuck with a bug or come across something I didn&amp;rsquo;t know of, I&amp;rsquo;d learn something new, fix it and move on. While this works great for me, it&amp;rsquo;s a wealth of knowledge that I&amp;rsquo;m keeping all to myself. I wanted to be able to pass on the intriguing lessons I learnt to other people who might want to hear the stories I brought back from the pits I fell into (no, not like Bruce Wayne).</description>
